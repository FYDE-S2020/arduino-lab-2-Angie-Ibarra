## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    provide an adress for each device connected to a computer network to allow for communication between devices.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    It is a "domain name system" and it is beneficial because it is easier to understand because it is the URL and not just a string of numbers. 

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    A static IP address does not change where as a dynamic one is assigned by the network when they connect and change over time. 

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    In UDP, if a packet is lost, it is forgotten but in TCP you never lose data but it incurs "latency". 

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Because then we would only be able to run this function.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    It stops script execution until it is done running. 

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Because then you can run several functions simultaneously. 

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface defines how a function is called whereas implementation describes what the function actually does. It is important to make this distinction when writing your code.
